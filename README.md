# CEAP Waste Data Analysis Project

## Project Introduction
The CEAP Waste Data Analysis project, led by Mind Your Plastic (MYP) and under the leadership of Yash Tailor as the team leader, focuses on combating plastic pollution through educational and cleanup initiatives across Canada. This comprehensive project evaluates the impact of the Circular Economy Ambassador Program (CEAP) and its role in fostering sustainable waste management practices.

## About Mind Your Plastic (MYP)

## Circular Economy Ambassador Program (CEAP)
### Objectives
- **Educational Enhancement:** To integrate environmental education into schools, providing students and educators with practical tools to combat plastic pollution.
- **Behavioral Change:** To shift community behaviors towards sustainability through active participation in cleanup events and recycling initiatives.
- **Circular Economy Advocacy:** To promote the reuse and recycling of materials, highlighting the benefits of a circular economy in reducing waste.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** To gather and analyze data from nationwide cleanup events, providing insights into effective strategies and areas for improvement in waste management.

## Key Components of the Project
- **Leadership:** As the team leader, Yash Tailor effectively coordinated a team of four members, steering project activities and ensuring data integrity and analytical rigor.
- **Data Collection:** Systematic collection of waste data from cleanup events across various Canadian provinces to track types and sources of waste.
- **Survey Implementation:** Conducting pre- and post-event surveys to measure shifts in participants' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding plastic pollution.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilizing advanced statistical methods to analyze data and assess the effectiveness of the CEAP initiatives.
- **Insight and Strategy Development:** Drawing actionable insights to refine future campaigns, focusing on the most impactful strategies to reduce waste.

## Impact and Achievements
- **Reduction in Single-Use Plastics:** Notable decreases in specific waste items such as cigarette butts and plastic straws, attributed to targeted educational campaigns and community cleanup efforts.
- **Behavioral Improvements:** Enhanced recycling practices and increased environmental awareness among participants, particularly students.
- **Support for Policy Development:** The data and insights have supported the development of policies aimed at reducing plastic pollution and promoting recycling.

## Future Directions
- **Expansion of Educational Programs:** To include more schools and communities, particularly in underrepresented regions.
- **Enhanced Data Collection:** To cover more diverse waste items and incorporate newer waste management technologies.
- **Broader Community Engagement:** To involve more stakeholders in the program, enhancing the collective impact on waste reduction.

## Conclusion
The CEAP Waste Data Analysis project demonstrates the powerful role of education and community engagement in driving environmental change. By continuing to build on these initiatives, MYP aims to lead a sustained effort towards a cleaner, more sustainable Canada.
